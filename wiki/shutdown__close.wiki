    Basically, shutdown closes a socket "politely" by sending a FIN and waiting for the peer to finish (FIN -> ACK/FIN -> ACK -> closed), at which point you call close and all is good.
    If you call close without calling shutdown  first, it's the "impolite" version which sends a RST -- the equivalent of hanging up in the middle of a phone call, without waiting for the other person to finish what they're saying.

    Think of "shutdown" as "say goodbye", and "close" as "hang up". You always have to hang up, but you don't have to say goodbye first.
